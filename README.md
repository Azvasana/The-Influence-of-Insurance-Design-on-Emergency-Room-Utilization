This repository contains the data files and the code used in the research project by Kritika Gowda for her final project for Incentives, Uncertainty, and Decisions in Healthcare at Johns Hopkins University.

The data used here is merged datasets taken from MEPS and is intended to delve into the use of HDHPs and LDHPs and how they can lead to difference in usage of emergency room utilizations. This takes into account several factors such as family socioeconomic status, education, age and pre-existing conditions.
