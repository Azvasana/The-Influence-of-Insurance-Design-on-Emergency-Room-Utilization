# The Influence of Insurance Design on Emergency Room Utilization

#### Analysis of High-Deductible and Low-Deductible Health Plans

This repository contains the data files and the code used in the research project by Kritika Gowda for her final project for Incentives, Uncertainty, and Decisions in Healthcare at Johns Hopkins University. 

The data used here are merged datasets taken from MEPS. The study is intended to delve into the use of HDHPs and LDHPs and how they can lead to differences in emergency room utilization. A summary of characteristics is explored before several factors, such as family socioeconomic status, education, age, and pre-existing conditions, are taken into account to see how they interact with ER Utilization.
